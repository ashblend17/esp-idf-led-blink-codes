The code for the blinking of the LED is given inside main\main.c file

Change the GPIO pin numbers from the main\main.c file according to the pin number you have connected the LED and BUTTON to.

Components folder is not used here. I have modified the simple Blink function (..\Blink) to include a BUTTON and the LED starts blinking/stops when BUTTON is toggled.
