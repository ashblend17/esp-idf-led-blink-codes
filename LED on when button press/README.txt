The code for the blinking of the LED is given inside main\main.c file

Change the GPIO pin numbers from the main\main.c file according to the pin number you have connected the LED to.

Components folder is not used here. I have modified the simple Blink function (..\Blink) to include a button and the LED stays on for the duration the button stays pressed.
